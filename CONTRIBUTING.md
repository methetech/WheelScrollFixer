# Contributing to WheelScrollFixer

We welcome contributions to the WheelScrollFixer! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

*   **Check existing issues**: Before opening a new issue, please check if a similar bug has already been reported.
*   **Provide detailed information**: When reporting a bug, include:
    *   A clear and concise description of the bug.
    *   Steps to reproduce the behavior.
    *   Expected behavior.
    *   Screenshots or videos if applicable.
    *   Your operating system and Python version.

### Suggesting Enhancements

*   **Check existing suggestions**: See if your idea has already been proposed.
*   **Describe your idea**: Clearly explain the enhancement and why it would be beneficial.

We also maintain a **[Project Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)** with a list of desired features. If you're looking for ideas on what to contribute, that's a great place to start!

### Code Contributions

1.  **Fork the repository**.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-fix-name
    ```
3.  **Make your changes**.
4.  **Write clear, concise commit messages**.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
    *   Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the `main` branch.
    *   Provide a clear description of your changes.
    *   Reference any related issues.

## Code Style & Safety

*   **PEP 8**: Follow standard Python styling.
*   **Thread Safety**: This application uses a multi-threaded architecture (GUI + MouseHook). Any changes to shared state (like Settings) MUST respect the "Atomic Snapshot" pattern or use appropriate locking. Do NOT introduce race conditions.

## Development Setup

To set up your development environment, follow the installation steps in `README.md`.

When running the application for development, it is recommended to use the `--no-watchdog` flag. This will prevent the watchdog from restarting the application if it crashes or is closed.

```bash
python WheelScrollFixer.py --no-watchdog
```
